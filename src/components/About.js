                <p className="lead l-2 text-white">I worked as a software engineer at an ODM. Our department was responsible for the BIOS development on laptops. 
                    Working at a large enterprise taught me not only substantial knowledge in the embedded system but also the spirit of working in a team. 
                    Those challenges I got gave me the motivation to keep digging in programming. I appreciate the experience from my previous job since it helped me to find my passion.<br /><br /> 
                    For digging into object-oriented programming, I started taking programs in BCIT and got several certificates and Diploma of Computer Systems Technology. 
                    I have built several projects such as iOS application, android application, websites, and so on. <br /><br />
                    I'm fond of coding, and there is always a bunch of ideas running in my head. 
                    Solving problems makes me feel accomplished. Technologies and programming languages are changing from time to time, having the skill to learn fast is my asset. <br />
